          <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
          <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
            world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
          penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
          animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>
              As we learn more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a
              sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. The Earth is what we all have in common.

              of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

            <p>
              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early
              navigators who used the stars to travel by.

              Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets
              in our solar system.

          <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
            Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
