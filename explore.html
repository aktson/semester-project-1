            Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our resources
            and contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of universities around the
            country.

            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about
            Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to
            be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
